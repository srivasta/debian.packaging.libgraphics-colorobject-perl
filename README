Graphics/ColorObject version 0.4a4
============================


UPGRADING FROM 0.3a2 AND OLDER VERSIONS

This version is a complete rewrite since the previous version, 0.3a2.
The API is completely changed.  The old API should be emulated, but
that has not been tested as extensively as I'd like. Therefore, please
test any code that uses this module when upgrading. If you encounter
any strange behavior, please downgrade to 0.3a2 and email me a bug
report.  Additionally, the exact values returned by some functions may
be slightly different, this is not a bug - the new values are (more)
correct.  


QUICK START

Convert from one color space to another:

use Graphics::ColorObject;
($h, $s, $v) = @{ Graphics::ColorObject->new_RGB([$r, $g, $b])->as_HSV() };

You can convert between any of these color spaces: XYZ, xyY, Lab,
LCHab, RGB, YPbPr, YCbCr.

For more detailed info, type:

perldoc ColorObject.pm
